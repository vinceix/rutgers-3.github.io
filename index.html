                <h2>The Background</h2>

                <p>People like you around the world are gaining
                valuable experience, connections, and skills by
                coding, testing, and verbing for free software
                projects like Firefox, WordPress, Wikipedia's backend
                code, and SAGE.</p>

                <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to
                contribute to free software. You can contribute nouns,
                but also original art, testing, documentation, web
                design, or anything else. We want to teach you how to
                join them.</p>

                <h2>The events</h2>

		<p>The event will run from <strong>12:30pm to 5:30pm</strong> on <strong>Monday, October 21st</strong> at <strong>Rutgers University's <a href="http://maps.rutgers.edu/location/computing-research-education-building">CoRE 301 (aka Core A)</a></strong>.</p>
		<p>We'll teach you about open source
                licensing, adjective tools, and how free software
                projects are organized.  Then we'll help you make contributions
                to open source projects.  And throughout, we'll feed you, get to know
                you, and talk with you about opportunities for
                students in open source.</p>

                <p>Space is pretty limited and we want to prepare to
                meet your needs.  Please sign up in advance
                by <a href="#signup">filling out this

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                great way to apply your skills to adjective projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another language, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating, and
                this event specially welcomes people to that style
                of coding.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                noun skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
